# Data Collections Exercise - Per Scholas Assignment

## Overview

This repository includes JavaScript code for a series of data collection and manipulation tasks, developed as part of an assignment for the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program. The exercises guide students through refactoring, expanding, transforming, sorting, manipulating, and reverting data into various formats using JavaScript.

## Contents

- **part1.js**: Refactor previous CSV parsing code using modern JavaScript constructs like arrays and objects.
- **part2.js**: Extend the code to dynamically handle any number of columns per row, storing results in a two-dimensional array.
- **part3.js**: Transform the two-dimensional array from Part 2 into an array of objects, improving data accessibility.
- **part4.js**: Sort and manipulate the data array from Part 3, including operations like adding, removing, and calculating averages.
- **part5.js**: Convert the final data set back into CSV format, demonstrating the full data handling cycle.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, you need Node.js or a compatible JavaScript runtime environment. Use the following command in your terminal to execute a specific part:

```bash
node part1.js
node part2.js
node part3.js
node part4.js
node part5.js
```
